# Python - Importing Modules

This directory contains exercises and examples focused on importing modules in Python. These exercises are completed as part of the Holberton School.

## Description

The `python-import_modules` directory includes Python scripts that demonstrate the usage of importing modules and functions from external files. The goal is to understand how to organize code into separate modules and how to import and use functions defined in those modules.

## Prerequisites

To run the scripts in this directory, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To run a script, navigate to this directory in your terminal and execute the script with Python. For example:

```bash
python3 0-import_function.py
```
